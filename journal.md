- Unsplash API random in const
- for API-parameters they come at the end of API with &para=
- fn getPhotos from API with try()-Catch()
  - fetch in const response
  - and the data to json
  - login unsplash for ACCESS_KEY
- DRY-Koncept
- Check to see if scrolling near bottom of page, load more photos
- check with EL when each image is finished loading in displayPhotos()
- imageLoaded() to check when all images loaded
  - variable for total images number, when it's done loading everything, this equal PhotosArray.length
  - variable for amount of images loaded, that will increase everytime an new image has been loaded
  - variable bool when all images loaded "ready = true"
- scroll-EL() only when variable ready is true
